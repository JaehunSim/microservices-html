#### Many languages, many options
The growth of JVM as a platform is just the latest example of mixing languages within a common platform. It's been common practice to shell-out to a higher level language to take advantage of higher level abstractions for decades. As is dropping down to the metal and writing performance sensitive code in a lower level one. However, many monoliths don't need this level of performance optimisation nor are DSL's and higher level abstractions that common (to our dismay). Instead monoliths are usually single language and the tendency is to limit the number of technologies in use [9].
